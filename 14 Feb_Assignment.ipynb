    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. In other words, each thread is blocked waiting for a resource that is held by another thread, and no thread can proceed until the other releases the resource. This creates a circular dependency that can result in a program that is stuck in a deadlock, unable to make progress. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, as they can involve multiple threads and resources.\n",

Rare conditions can occur when threads are not properly synchronized or coordinated, and can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, and other types of thread-related bugs."
